#How to Stop Being Tracked Online

The internet is an amazing thing. You can find information, communicate, and buy things almost instantly. But the problem with the internet is that you can be tracked. Think about what you do online in a typical day. You might check your e-mail, search for information, or buy something. All of these things are influenced by tracking. There are lots of ways websites track you. Here are some of the ways websites track you and how to prevent them from tracking you.

##Cookie Tracking
One way uses a thing called a cookie. A cookie is a small bit of text that a website can store on your computer.

Cookies are usually harmless, but a website can use them to remember your computer and store information about you in their database.
For example, the website might track what you search for in their database and then sell the data to a company that uses it to send you ads.
Fortunately, it is easy to prevent cookies from tracking you. In "Incognito", "InPrivate", or "Private Browsing" mode, cookies, history, and other data doesn't stay, so websites can't track you.

##Ad Tracking
Ads can track a lot of what you do online. The reason they can is that ads can see the content of the pages that they're on. For example, this is why when you search for "Tomato Cages" the ads you will see for a while after that might have something to do with tomato cages. A way you can stop this is by using a browser add-on called [AdBlock](http://getadblock.com)

##Google Tracking
Google tracks you. A lot. They probably have a record of everything you've searched for, watched on YouTube, and even most links you've clicked on Google websites. To check (and clear) your record go to [Google My Activity](https://myactivity.google.com). Another way to stop Google from tracking you is to use an alternate search engine such as [DuckDuckGo](http://ddg.gg). DuckDuckGo doesn't track you.
